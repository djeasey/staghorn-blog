height="6000"><figcaption><p>"Apollo and Daphne" a marble sculpture by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, recounting a Greek myth I did NOT get to hear about in my first week of Classics.</p><p>This depicts the story in which Daphne would rather turn into a bay tree than hook up with a complete stranger (here being Apollo who probably wanted to rape her because basically all the male Greek gods were rapists)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Undergrad, first week of Greek Classics.</p><p>Me, waiting to hear about Theseus slaying the Minotaur, or Heracles’ corpse engulfed in flames on Mount Oeta, or maybe even Zeus hoe-ing around and humping everything that moves (and maybe some things that don’t). Instead, to my outrage I am hit with a pile of readings about… Germanic fairy tales?!</p><p>The course was meant to be about ancient Greek Tragedies! As a frequently absent university student fond of the good nap, I had dragged by body out of bed and shown up at some heinously early (probably quite reasonable) hour, and was being presented with <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em>!</p><p>As my ire softened and I stopped furiously snapchatting people about my indignation, I caught wind of a discussion of the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index (ATU Index). This is a massive catalogue of folktales, originally German but expanded beyond, which codifies and categorises folktale stories, components, and motifs.</p><p> The nature of stories passed via word of mouth, the oral tradition, is that the narrative is chiefly in the hands of the storyteller. Every time the tale is shared it can be twisted, certain elements forgotten, certain added or embellished, some elements just mentioned in passing. Maybe <em>Cinderella’s</em> slipper wasn’t glass but rather gold. Maybe the <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> was too smart to be eaten by the <em>Wolf</em>, maybe she was eaten but the <em>Woodsman</em> rescued her. Maybe <em>Goldilocks’ </em>bears ate soup not porridge.</p><p> Do these differences matter? No. Small changes like the material of a shoe, or the culinary nature of an ursine dinner does not fundamentally change the story. So how do we categorise what is shared between different tellings of the same-ish folktale.</p><p> This is where the ATU Index comes in. The ATU Index, or more correctly, the ATU Index and Thompson Motif Index are a collection of tale-types, motifs, stereotyped characters and ideas in folk tales.</p><p> For example, categorized tales:</p><ul><li><em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> (ATU 333)</li><li><em>Cinderella </em>(ATU 510A)<ul><li>not to be mistaken for <em>Catskin</em> (ATU 510B), the similar but different narrative about a ill-treated daughter of a lord who runs away and lives as a peasant and wishes to attend a Ball against orders. She sneaks away and meets a young lord who wishes to marry her. Drama ensues.</li></ul></li><li>The Chinese Tale of <em>Hua Mulan</em> (ATU 514), a legendary “Shift of Sex Tale”</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1dnhlbjj31"><strong>The Thompson Motif Index</strong></h2><p>And for motifs we might look at Swan Lake’s use of “<em>D300-D399 Transformation: animals to person</em>”, specifically the subset “<em>D361.1 Swan maiden</em>”</p><p> We could apply this to a narrative arising from outside of the Germanic-Sphere. Perhaps, the tale of Aladdin with his magic Lamp (“<em>D800-D899 Ownership of magic objects</em>”) which causes “<em>D2100 Magic wealth</em>”. Or his monkey side-kick Abu in the Disney adaptation “<em>B300-B349 Helpful animals―general</em>”. We might go on to discuss his Disguise as Price Ali (“<em>K1800-K1899 Deceptions by Disguise or Illusion</em>”), and arguably if we are cynical enough “<em>K1300-K1399 Seduction or Deceptive Marriage</em>”.</p><p>We continue on ad nauseum, but the point is, this system allows us to see the connections between these motifs, these stories, and even these cultures in the way they handle elements of folktale.</p><p>How does this apply to our Ancient Greeks? Well what is the story of the titan Prometheus stealing fire from Olympus to give to humanity, and his eternal repeating punishment, if not “<em>A1100-A1699 Creation and ordering of human life</em>” and subset “<em>A1415 Theft of fire</em>” from “<em>A100-A499 Gods</em>” resulting in “<em>Q500. Tedious punishments</em>” and “<em>E670. Repeated reincarnation</em>”.</p><p>These motifs seem to transcend age and culture, be it the “<em>D113.1. 1 Werewolf</em>” of the historical Swiss Werewolf Trials, or the “<em>D10-D99 Transformation of man to different man</em>” of Harry Potter’s Polyjuice Potion, the “<em>C961.1 Transformation to pillar of salt for breaking taboo</em>” of the Bible’s Wife of Lot or the Greek’s Eurydice.</p><p>Whilst some of the vocabulary of the system is evidently grounded in Germanic folktale, the applications have extended beyond cultures. For example, concepts like <em>“G. Ogres”</em>, can be considered to include general <em>Non-Mundane Beasts</em> or perhaps <em>Demons</em>. </p><p>This system of analysing folktales creates a lens though which we can view all narratives. No culture’s legends are so unique that they cannot tick a couple of boxes. No ancient fable is so remote that it’s structure cannot be identified. These systems show us that humans are not so different and our stories are the same. For what is the purpose of storytelling? To explain the phenomenon of lightning to our pre-electrophysical communities? To teach our children not to walk idly in the woods on their way to Grandma? Or maybe just to keep us entertained while we huddle around the fire or drift off to sleep, dreaming of shoes made of glass and bears eating porridge. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1dnhlbveh2"><strong>GEEK NOTES: <a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/jungs-archetypes/">Jung’s Collective Unconscious &amp; Archetypes</a></strong></h2><p>A similar concept to Aarne-Thompson-Uther indices is the Swiss Psychiatrist Carl Jung’s concept of <em>Archetypes</em>. Intellectual adversary and friend to Sigmund Freud (and potential repressed but reciprocated homo-erotic object of desire), Jung presented similar but divergent thoughts on Freud’s new field of psychoanalysis. </p><p>Freud’s Model of the psych consisted of three psychic apparatuses:</p><ul><li><strong>The Id (Latin: “it”)</strong> = Disorganised instinctual component constructed of desires, impulses, and drives, present from birth. Driven by the <em>Pleasure Principle</em> to seek gratification and avoiding pain. This apparatus is completely unconscious and unknown to the conscious mind.</li><li><strong>The Ego (Latin: “I”)</strong> = The organised, cognitive and executive component which seeks to restrain the Id by grounding itself in the reality of the world. Driven by the <em>Reality Principle</em> to seek ways to gratify the id in a way which will maximise long term pleasure and minimise pain. This is achieved by rationalization and reason. This apparatus is largely conscious and sub/preconscious.</li><li><strong>The Super-Ego</strong> = The internalisation of outside world’s culture and rules. The “conscience”, the Super-Ego contradicts the Id, wanting to act with decorum and is outraged and shamed by the depravity of the Id. This apparatus spans from the conscious, via the pre-conscious, into the deep unconscious.</li></ul><p>Thus Freud could discuss mental disorders as conflicts between the <em>Ego</em> and the <em>Id </em>(<em>Transference Neuroses</em>)<em>,</em> between the <em>Ego</em> and the<em> Super-Ego</em> (<em>Narcissistic Neuroses</em>)<em>,</em> and between the <em>Ego</em> and the external world (<em>Psychoses)</em>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jung divided the psyche into the conscious <em>Ego</em>, the <em>Personal Unconscious</em> (our recalled and repressed memories), and the <em>Collective Unconscious</em>.</p><p>Jung’s take, informed heavily by Eastern philosophy, was that the <em>Collective Unconscious</em> was populated by human instinct and abstractions called ‘<em>Archetypes’</em>.  Jungian psychology, now termed <em>Analytic Psychology</em>, examined how the psych strove, and more often than not failed and stagnated, to pursue its goal of self-realisation via the process of individuation, the formation of a robust and whole sense of self. The interplays between states of progress in individuation and issues encountered would be seen by analysing a patient’s dreams and thoughts. Symbolic elements of dreams for example would considered the implication of these symbolic archetypes, what they meant to the patient, and how the symbolic interplay of their narrative could be interpreted as representing psychological states.</p><p>These archetypes are universally relatable symbols and can be considered a simplified version of Aarne-Thompson-Uther’s motifs: A great/earth mother, a wise sage, the duality of light and dark. Some of these archetypes, being abstract symbols, can over-lap or be subsets of each other, others can be mixed flavours.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/media/posts/3/Venus_de_Milo_Paris_2_September_2013_001.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/media/posts/3/responsive/Venus_de_Milo_Paris_2_September_2013_001-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/media/posts/3/responsive/Venus_de_Milo_Paris_2_September_2013_001-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/media/posts/3/responsive/Venus_de_Milo_Paris_2_September_2013_001-md.jpg 768w ,https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/media/posts/3/responsive/Venus_de_Milo_Paris_2_September_2013_001-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/media/posts/3/responsive/Venus_de_Milo_Paris_2_September_2013_001-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/media/posts/3/responsive/Venus_de_Milo_Paris_2_September_2013_001-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" data-aspectratio="0.666667" width="2848" height="4272"><figcaption><p>The "Venus de Milo" by Alexandros of Antioche, a marble sculpture of the Greek goddess Aphrodite. When discussing the Greek gods in terms of Jungian Archetypes, Aphrodite (the embodiment of love and beauty) is a projected and symbolic incarnation of internal archetypes (here being of feminine sexuality, love, and beauty) (photo by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Venus_de_Milo,_Paris_2_September_2013_001.jpg">Tom King</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>These internal archetypes are projected onto the external world as simplified way of viewing complex ideas. June Singer discussed some more well-studied archetypes in terms of opposites, one set pertaining to the <em>Ego</em> the other to the abstract notion of the <em>Shadow</em>. Light (ego) is opposed by Darkness (shadow), the Old Wise Man (ego) is opposed by the Trickster (shadow), the Great Mother (ego) is opposed by the Tyrannical Father (shadow), et cetera. The implication of the Chinese philosophy of Yin and Yang, is unmistakable.</p><p>Jung however would argue that the metaphysics and cosmologies of eastern philosophy, of astrology, of alchemy, of mythology, all of which he was well versed in, were simply the human psyche projecting these archetypical symbols onto external phenomena. The process of Alchemy, it’s various procedures, were imbued with the symbols of the internal psych, with the progress towards <em>The Great Work</em> of Alchemy (e.g. formation of the <em>Philosopher’s Stone) </em>marked by a progress of archetypical symbols towards <em>The Great Work</em> of personal psychology: Self-Realisation.</p><p>So what are these archetypes? Well given the ethereal and blended nature, delineating individual and unique archetypes is difficult, and at times down-right futile. Nevertheless a number of Jungian psychologists, mystics, artists, and anthropologists have tried.</p><p>In his posthumously compiled works <em>Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious</em>, Jung explicitly refers to 12 main archetypes, whilst acknowledging the existence of many others:</p><ul><li>The Self</li><li>The Anima</li><li>The Animus</li><li>The Shadow</li><li>The Persona</li><li>The Father</li><li>The Mother</li><li>The Child</li><li>The Wise Old (Sage)</li><li>The Hero</li><li>The Trickster</li><li>The Maiden</li></ul><p>In Margaret Mark and Carol Pearson’s book <em>The Hero and the Outlaw</em> a guide to distinct branding directed by principles of myth and pop-psychology define a different 12 archetypes:</p><ul><li>The Innocent</li><li>The Orphan</li><li>The Hero</li><li>The Caregiver</li><li>The Explorer</li><li>The Rebel</li><li>The Lover</li><li>The Creator</li><li>The Jester</li><li>The Sage</li><li>The Magician</li><li>The Ruler </li></ul><p>This has been used also as a system of personality typing and alignment. Largely popular personality typing systems can be considered to employ ideas of archetypes such as: personality enneagrams, various zodiacs, Myer’s Briggs personality types etc.</p><hr><p>Banner image edited from an <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Greek_Eros_vase.png">attic red vase</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 21 October 2019</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/aarne-thompson-uther-index/">aarne-thompson-uther-index</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/archetypes/">archetypes</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/carl-jung/">carl-jung</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/classics/">Classics</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/fairytales/">fairytales</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/folktales/">folktales</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/freud/">freud</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/germanic-myth/">germanic-myth</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/greek-myth/">greek-myth</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/jung/">jung</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/jungian-archetypes/">jungian-archetypes</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/motifs/">motifs</a></li><li><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/tag/psychology/">psychology</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/pothos-basics/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Propagating Pothos &amp; Why We Prune</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/blank-linguistics/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Toki Pona: The lili-est Language You Haven’t Heard of Yet </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-10-21T12:08" class="feed__date">21 October 2019</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/jungs-archetypes/" class="invert">Jung’s Collective Unconscious &amp; Archetypes</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><center><p>corrections are not just welcomed but invited: <a href="mailto:staghornblog@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact</a></p><p> </p><div class="fb-like" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/staghornblog/" data-width="" data-layout="standard" data-action="like" data-size="small" data-show-faces="true" data-share="true"> </div></center></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://djeasey.github.io/staghorn-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
